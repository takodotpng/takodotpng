about me ;
- i really like pokemon, vocaloid, twisted wonderland, black butler, bugs, and dinosaurs :)
- if you don't like seeing a specific type of animal/need a tw please tell me! i like to send pictures of animals i find cute to my friends (including insects, arachnids, amphibians, and reptiles)
- i LOVE yapping about my interests, if i start it probably means i like you
- call me team yama the way i love pokemon evil teams am i right

talk to me about ;
- pokemon!! currently hyperfixating :)
- guzma!! current character hyperfixation
- any of my interests, especially black butler!!

things you should know before interacting ;
- i'm not very good at telling tone or intent through text sometimes
- most likely autistic/adhd/something of the sort, be patient please
- social anxiety; i'd prefer to dm when we first interact, and if i seem reserved or scared, i probably am (nothing against you specifically ofc, if we end up interacting more i'll open up :) )
- i like to playfully insult my friends; if i'm beefing w someone 99% of the time they're one of my friends

favorite pokemon i've had in the games ;
- james pond - inteleon, male, bold + "quick to flee" - my galar starter and also my babygirl, he's a boyfailure to me
- raspberry - _shiny_ scolipede, male, lax + "good perserverance" - my first ever shiny, full odds, reset the game for 2 hours straight until i got him <3 love him
- glorp - _shiny_ espeon, male, quiet + "highly persistent" - named glorp for being BRIGHT FUCKING GREEN!!!!, caught in a friend ball and someone hypertrained him, leveled him to 100, and had him hold a beast ball in thanks for my evolving their sliggoo since they couldn't get it to rain :)
- koraidon - ...koraidon, genderless (but i use he/him), quirky + "likes to thrash about" - the koraidon you get at the start in scarlet, my beloved dragon bike, occasionally called "big red" after secretariat and because he's big and red
- lyney - meowscarada, male, lonely + "mischievous" - my paldea starter and my cute little kitty
- psychopomp - hisuian typhlosion, male, docile - my hisui starter and my first ever pokemon in a mainline game, my darling and my beloved even if he does look high as a kite

dni ;
- basic dni criteria
- radqueer/radqueer supporters
- hardcore ai supporters - if you use it casually i don't care but if you're a full on ai bro i don't want to interact with you
- people who don't like my selfshipping with fictional characters - doesn't hurt you if i want to fantasize about dating a fake man i promise
- nothing much else, be chill and i won't have a problem with you

iwc ;
- hating on my favorite characters/pokemon/games - if it's obviously a joke idm though
- ruikasa/akitoya/anhane shippers (not homophobic promise just don't want to get shit on for the ships i like and i feel like these ships have a lot of people who are all too happy to do that)
- hardcore ai haters - if you dislike it i get it but if you're like "I HATE AI AND I HOPE ALL AI BROS DIE AND CHATGPT GETS SHUT DOWN RN!!!!" or some other overreaction like that i probably don't want to talk to you
- proshippers - i quite honestly do not care all that much about what weird ships you like but don't tell me about them and ideally dni if you want to
- dsmp likers - most of the people i've seen who like the dsmp are weird as hell i'm sorry 😭
